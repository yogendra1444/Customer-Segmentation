# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using KMeans - iFood Dataset

This project applies unsupervised machine learning (KMeans Clustering) to segment customers based on their behavior and spending habits using the `ifood_df.csv` dataset.

---

## 📌 Objective

To analyze customer data and group them into clusters for targeted marketing, personalized offers, and better customer understanding.

## 📊 Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning**  
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
- **Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)**  
- **KMeans Clustering**  
- **Elbow Method for optimal K**  
- **PCA for Visualization**  

---

## 📉 Visualizations

- **Elbow Curve** to find the optimal number of clusters  
- **PCA Scatter Plot** to visualize clusters in 2D  
- **Cluster-wise Analysis** of customer behaviors

---

## ✅ Output

- Customers are segmented into 4 clusters.
- Each cluster represents a group of similar behavior based on spending, recency, etc.
