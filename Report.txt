ðŸ“Œ 1. Project Title
Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

ðŸ“Œ 2. Objective
To segment customers based on purchasing behavior using clustering techniques, so the business can personalize marketing strategies and improve sales.

ðŸ“Œ 3. Dataset Summary
Dataset: ifood_df.csv

Total Rows: ~2200 customers

Features include:

Demographics: Age, Income, Education, Marital Status

Spending: Wines, Meat, Fruits, etc.

Online Activity: Web visits, Web purchases

Campaign Response

ðŸ“Œ 4. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Removed rows with missing Income

Created new feature: Age = 2025 - Year_Birth

Selected relevant features for clustering

Standardized data using StandardScaler

ðŸ“Œ 5. Clustering
Used KMeans Clustering

Applied Elbow Method â†’ Chose k=4

Assigned each customer to a cluster (0â€“3)

Saved the model in models/kmeans_model.pkl

ðŸ“Œ 6. Visualizations
Bar Plots: Education & Marital Status distribution

PCA Plot: Visual representation of clusters

Elbow Curve: Showed optimal number of clusters

ðŸ“Œ 7. Cluster Insights (example)
You can add a few insights like:

Cluster 0: High spenders, older, married

Cluster 1: Young, low income, low spending

Cluster 2: Medium income, buys more wine

Cluster 3: Engages online, shops via catalog

ðŸ“Œ 8. Conclusion
The customer base was successfully segmented into 4 distinct groups. These insights can help:

Personalize email campaigns

Design product bundles

Identify loyal vs. inactive customers

ðŸ“Œ 9. Future Work (Optional)
Build a recommendation system

Add deep learning for behavior prediction

Deploy on a web app (e.g., Streamlit)
